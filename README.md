# Height-Balanced Masonry Columns

Two-Column Height-Balanced Masonry Layout (Greedy Packing Algorithm)
This code snippet implements a pure CSS and JavaScript-based 2-column layout that dynamically distributes blocks to minimize vertical whitespace. Unlike standard grid or flexbox systems that align items row-wise or by count, this layout prioritizes total column height balance, ensuring a clean and aesthetic look ‚Äî especially when block heights vary.

üîç How It Works:
All content blocks are temporarily rendered off-screen to allow accurate height measurement (even if hidden).

JavaScript measures each block‚Äôs true height, including spacing.

It then uses a greedy algorithm to assign each block to the column with the lowest cumulative height.

This ensures that both columns grow together, staying as close in height as possible ‚Äî minimizing leftover white space.

‚úÖ Perfect For Scenarios Like:
     Dashboard widgets or tile-based UIs (e.g., analytics blocks)
     Portfolio or gallery layouts where items differ in size
     Blog feed layouts that auto-distribute mixed content cards
     Dynamic content feeds where block height is unknown until runtime
     Visual balance between two scroll columns for user experience

üß† Key Features:
     Responsive-friendly foundation
     No third-party libraries needed
     Handles dynamic block heights
     Visual consistency across devices
